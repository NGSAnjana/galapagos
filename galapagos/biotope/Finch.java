 * Finches are passerine birds, often seed-eating, found chiefly in
 * the northern hemisphere and Africa. One subfamily is endemic to the
 * Neotropics. The taxonomic structure of the true finch family,
 * Fringillidae, is somewhat disputed, with some including the
 * Hawaiian honeycreepers as another subfamily (Drepanidinae) and/or
 * uniting the cardueline and fringilline finches as tribes
 * (Carduelini and Fringillini) in one subfamily; the euphonious
 * finches were thought to be tanagers due to general similarity in
 * appearance and mode of life until their real affinities were
 * realized; the buntings and American sparrows were
 * formerly considered another subfamily (Emberizinae). Przewalski's
 * "Rosefinch" (Urocynchramus pylzowi) is now classified as a
 * distinct, monotypic family with no particularly close
 * relatives.

 * "Classic" or true finches are small to moderately large and have a
 * strong, stubby beaks, which in some species can be quite large. All
 * have tail feathers and 9 primaries. They have a bouncing flight,
 * alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings, and
 * most sing well. Their nests are basket-shaped and built in trees.

 * There are many birds in other families which are often called
 * finches. These include many species in the very similar-looking
 * Estrildids or waxbill family, which occur in the Old World tropics
 * and Australia. Several groups of the Emberizidae family (buntings
 * and American sparrows) are also named as finches, including the
 * Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands, which provided evidence
 * of Darwin's theory of evolution.
